== Trimmer

The trimmer lost the screws to the mid-section of the pole.
Bought a nut and screw to keep the metal clamped.
Just need a screw to fit the top hole.
The screw I bought today did not worked.
When applying the screw to the hole, the screw would start for about two
turns.
To me, this looks like I need a smaller screw.
I am putting the screw in the bathroom where I put my wallet.
This will let me know where the screw is.
