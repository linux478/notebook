- made decision to divide drawing up on three pages
- the pages are divide into the following
    - Boiler 1 and blowndown separator skid
    - Boiler 2 and blowndown separator skid
    - Feed water tank
- change the scale in model space to 1:1
    - do not see a reason to scale the drawing and make things more difficult
- the title in the title block will not change
- a title will be added in the drawing space
- the sheets will be numbered according
    - 1 of 3
    - 2 of 3
    - 3 of 3
- Talked with Kyle and he was ok with revision blocks on each pages and the
  revision block on get reved if there is a change to that page.
