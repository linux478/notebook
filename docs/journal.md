    - slope on the next line (ex: SLOPE: 1/2" PER 1-0')
    - length on the next line (ex: LENGTH: 18'-0")
    - box around the information
    - filled circle to anchor a leader to the line
    - the leader pointing to the box
    - similar to first image 
    - call out text will be in the form of the second image
    - this can be accomplished by a multileader.
